If you want to see visual representations for each implementation before reading the documentation, like character interactions and dialogue, objective mechanics like catching a fish, cooking, and much more, [A Dropbox link is available.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/pfwxpptmny7z9q3yzszba/AMsKb4H2txQgSXODNPbkuyU?rlkey=rzvb1vh2fcwj47t54txzl67ks&st=umbg66l8&dl=0)

# Introduction

This project is a graduation project that I and my team worked on. It is a 3D platformer game in which you play as a character who is looking for their child. We developed the game to be an introduction for people who want to enter the gaming world but are having a hard time doing so as, in our current day and age, games are more complex in terms of game systems and more difficult. Therefore, we wanted to develop a game that anyone can play and finish. especially children, who are our main target demographic, but other demographics can have fun.

The game is a 3D platformer game because 3D platformers mostly focus on movement and passing obstacles, and as someone who is still new to this medium, it is the ideal game type to help players get good at moving characters and get them more comfortable with the controls.
